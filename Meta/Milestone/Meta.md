# Milestones

> Project milestones - time-boxed development phases with clear deliverables

**Documents**: 1 template + milestones

## Milestone Lifecycle

```
Draft → Active → Complete → Archived
```

- **Draft**: Planning phase, scope not finalized
- **Active**: Currently being worked on
- **Complete**: All deliverables verified
- **Archived**: Historical record

## Conventions

### Task Status
- `[ ]` - Not started
- `[~]` - In progress
- `[x]` - Complete

### Duration Guidelines
- Each milestone should be 1-4 weeks
- Longer efforts should be split into multiple milestones

## Index

| Milestone | Title | Status | Target |
|-----------|-------|--------|--------|
| [M1](M1.md) | Project Scaffolding | Draft | 2026-02-28 |

1. Copy `_TEMPLATE.md` to `M{N}.md`
2. Fill in Goal and Scope first
3. Break down into specific Tasks
4. Define acceptance criteria in Test Plan
5. Update this index
