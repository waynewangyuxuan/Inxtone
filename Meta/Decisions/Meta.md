# Architecture Decision Records

> Significant technical decisions documented for future reference

**Documents**: 2 templates + ADRs

## What is an ADR?

An ADR captures a single architectural decision, including:
- The context and problem we faced
- The decision we made
- Alternatives we considered
- Consequences (both positive and negative)

## How to Write an ADR

1. Copy `_TEMPLATE.md` to `ADR-{NEXT_NUMBER}-{kebab-case-title}.md`
2. Fill in all sections
3. Set status to "Proposed"
4. Get review from relevant stakeholders
5. Update status to "Accepted" once approved

## ADR Lifecycle

```
Proposed → Accepted → [Deprecated | Superseded]
```

## Index

| Number | Title | Status | Date |
|--------|-------|--------|------|
